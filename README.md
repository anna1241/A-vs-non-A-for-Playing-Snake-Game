# Snake Game: A* Algorithm vs Non-A* Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements the classic Snake game with two different AI strategies: one using the A* algorithm and the other using a simpler non-A* approach. The goal is to compare the performance and efficiency of the A* algorithm against a basic algorithm in navigating the snake to food.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Game**: Play the classic Snake game with keyboard controls.
- **AI Opponent**: Watch the AI play the game using either the A* algorithm or a non-A* algorithm.
- **Performance Comparison**: Analyze and compare the performance of the A* algorithm versus the non-A* algorithm in terms of efficiency and success rate.

## How It Works

1. **Game Initialization**: The game initializes the snake and places food randomly on the board.
2. **Player Mode**: Play the game manually using keyboard controls.
3. **AI Mode**: Choose between the A* algorithm and non-A* algorithm for the AI to control the snake.
4. **A* Algorithm**: The AI uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate the snake towards the food, considering obstacles and optimizing the path.
5. **Non-A* Algorithm**: The AI uses a simpler algorithm, such as a greedy approach or random moves, to navigate the snake towards the food.
